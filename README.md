# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project is built using ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with enhanced animation effects using Framer Motion and GSAP.

## Tech Stack

- **ReactJS:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows me to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render components when the data changes.

- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the portfolio. It enables smooth transitions and dynamic content updates.

- **HTML:** The standard markup language for creating the structure of web pages. It provides the foundation for organizing and presenting the content on my portfolio.

- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets are used for styling and layout. CSS helps in making the portfolio visually appealing and responsive across different screen sizes.

- **Framer Motion:** A React animation library that simplifies the creation of complex animations. Framer Motion is employed to add engaging and interactive motion effects to various elements of the portfolio.

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** A powerful JavaScript animation library that allows for precise and high-performance animations. GSAP enhances the visual experience of the portfolio by providing advanced animation capabilities.
